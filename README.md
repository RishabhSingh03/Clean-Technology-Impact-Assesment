# Clean-Technology-Impact-Assesment
Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) projects on GHG emissions reduction. The study evaluates global trends, adoption patterns, and the estimated emissions reduction potential using real-world data from the IEA CCUS Projects Database.

🔍 Key Objectives

Assess CCUS project distribution by country and project type.
Identify trends in CCUS adoption over time.
Estimate the GHG reduction potential of various CCUS projects.
Develop data-driven insights using Python and Power BI.
📊 Data Sources

IEA CCUS Projects Database 2024
Open-source government reports on GHG emissions reduction policies
🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) – Data processing & visualization
Power BI – Interactive dashboards for emissions trends
Excel – Data cleaning & formatting
